# Stakeholder Updates

The API for Stakeholder Updates supports the following:

* initial selected sections for a new company
* data for the live view
* edit the live intro
* add/remove/reorder live sections
* create/share a stakeholder update (turns live view into a saved prior) 
* list of prior updates
* get a prior update
* remove a prior update
* remove section from the stakeholder updates section property when it's removed from the dashboard


## "Live" View

The template for the "live" and next pending stakeholder update exists as a property of the company with the following
format:

```
:stakeholder-update {
  :title ""
  :intro {
    :body ""
  }
  :outro {
    :body ""
  }
  :sections ["name" "name"]
}
```

Or with an intro:

```
:stakeholder-update {
  :title "Our Great Update"
  :intro {
    :body "Some text."
    :updated-at: "ISO8601"
    "author" : {
      "image" : "Avatar URL",
      "name" : "Full Name",
      "user-id" : "Slack ID"
    }
  :outro {
    :body ""
  }
  :sections ["name" "name"]
}
```

And on outro:

```
:stakeholder-update {
  :title "Our Great Update"
  :intro {
    :body "Some text."
    :updated-at: "ISO8601"
    "author" : {
      "image" : "Avatar URL",
      "name" : "Full Name",
      "user-id" : "Slack ID"
    }
  :outro {
    :body "Other text."
    :updated-at: "ISO8601"
    "author" : {
      "image" : "Avatar URL",
      "name" : "Full Name",
      "user-id" : "Slack ID"
    }
  }
  :sections ["name" "name"]
}
```

A "live" or "pending" stakeholder update can always be shown by showing the title, intro message (if there is one) and
the latest contents of each of the included sections in the specified order, then the outro message (if there is one).
When displaying a stakeholder update, any section that's in the stakeholder update but is not currently in the
dashboard (shouldn't actually happen) should be skipped. Any section that's still a placeholder should be skipped.


## Stakeholder Content Editing / Ordering

The intro for the "live" and next pending shared stakeholder update can be edited by `PATCH`ing the company.

Sections in the next pending stakeholder update can be added, removed, reordered by `PATCH`ing the company. Only
sections active in the dashboard can be included. Including other sections returns a `422` error.


## Stakeholder Update Creating

A blank POST to `/companies/{slug}/updates` creates a new stakeholder update from the current "live" pending
stakeholeder update and resets the intro to the blank state (no author, no timestamp, blank body). The authorized
user doing the POST is captured in the created stakeholder update as the author.


## List of Prior Stakeholder Updates

The list of past stakeholder updates can be retrieved by all users (auth'd and not) at: 

```
/companies/{slug}/updates
```

The response (assuming a user auth'd to the company, otherwise DELETE links will be missing):

```json
{
  "collection" : {
    "version" : "1.0",
    "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates",
    "links" : [ {
      "rel" : "self",
      "method" : "GET",
      "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates",
      "type" : "application/vnd.collection+vnd.open-company.stakeholder-update+json;version=1"
    } ],
    "stakeholder-updates" : [ {
      "title" : "December Update",
      "slug" : "december-update-4a6f",
      "intro": {
        "body": "It's been a helluva month!",
        "author" : {
          "image" : "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/46c1c756f36549c2dea0253e1e025053?s=96&d=mm&r=g",
          "name" : "Joel Gascoigne",
          "user-id" : "123456"
        }
      },
      "created-at": "2016-01-02T12:28:20.454Z",
      "links" : [ 
        {
          "rel" : "self",
          "method" : "GET",
          "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/december-update-4a6f",
          "type" : "application/vnd.open-company.stakeholder-update.v1+json"
        },
        {
          "rel" : "delete",
          "method" : "DELETE",
          "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/december-update-4a6f"
        }
      ]
    }, {
      "title" : "January Update",
      "slug" : "january-update-65b5",
      "intro": {
        "body": "It's been a helluva month!",
        "author" : {
          "image" : "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/46c1c756f36549c2dea0253e1e025053?s=96&d=mm&r=g",
          "name" : "Joel Gascoigne",
          "user-id" : "123456"
        }
      },
      "created-at": "2016-03-08T12:28:20.454Z",
      "links" : [
        {
          "rel" : "self",
          "method" : "GET",
          "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/january-update-65b5",
          "type" : "application/vnd.open-company.stakeholder-update.v1+json"
        },
        {
          "rel" : "delete",
          "method" : "DELETE",
          "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/january-update-65b5"
        }
      ]
    }, {
      "title" : "February Update",
      "slug" : "february-update-d786",
      "intro": {
        "body": "It's been a helluva month!",
        "author" : {
          "image" : "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/46c1c756f36549c2dea0253e1e025053?s=96&d=mm&r=g",
          "name" : "Joel Gascoigne",
          "user-id" : "123456"
        }
      },
      "created-at": "2016-03-12T12:28:20.454Z",
      "links" : [
        {
          "rel" : "self",
          "method" : "GET",
          "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/february-update-d786",
          "type" : "application/vnd.open-company.stakeholder-update.v1+json"
        },
        {
          "rel" : "delete",
          "method" : "DELETE",
          "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/february-update-d786"
        }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```

If the user is auth'd to the company, the company response's HATEOAS links will include a `POST` link to share a new
stakeholder update:

```json
...
    "links" : [ {
      "rel" : "self",
      "method" : "GET",
      "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates",
      "type" : "application/vnd.collection+vnd.open-company.stakeholder-update+json;version=1"
    }, {
      "rel" : "share",
      "method" : "POST",
      "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates"
    } ],
...
```

## Stakeholder Update Retrieval

A stakeholder update URL from the Location response to a `POST` or from the stakeholder update list can be retrieved
by `GET`ing the provided URL:

```
/companies/{slug}/updates/{slugified-title}-{uuid}
```

The response:

```json

  "name" : "Buffer",
  "slug": "january-update-65b5",
  "logo" : "https://open-company-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/buffer.png",
  "logo-width" : 300,

## Stakeholder Update Removal

A user auth'd to the company can remove the stakeholder update using the included HATEOAS link to `DELETE`:

```json
...
    "stakeholder-updates" : [ {
      "name" : "December Update",
      "created-at": "2016-01-02T12:28:20.454Z",
      "links" : [ {

        "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/december-update-4a6f",
        "type" : "application/vnd.open-company.stakeholder-update.v1+json"
      }, {
        "rel" : "self",
        "method" : "DELETE",
        "href" : "/companies/buffer/updates/december-update-4a6f"
      } ]
    },
...
```
