        :body
          "<h3>1. Choose positivity</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You strive to approach things in a positive and optimistic way</li>
            <li>You avoid criticizing or condemning team members or users</li>
            <li>You avoid complaining</li>
            <li>You let the other person save face, even if they are clearly wrong</li>
            <li>You are deliberate about giving genuine appreciation</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>2. Default to transparency</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You take pride in opportunities to share our beliefs, failures, strengths and decisions</li>
            <li>You use transparency as a tool to help others</li>
            <li>You always state your thoughts immediately and with honesty</li>
            <li>You share early in the decision process, to avoid \"big revelations\"</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>3. Focus on self-improvement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You are conscious of your current level of productivity and happiness, and make continual change to grow</li>
            <li>You have a higher expectation of yourself, than Buffer does of you</li>
            <li>You regularly and deliberately do things that make you feel uncomfortable</li>
            <li>You practice activities and develop habits that improve your mind and your body</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>4. Be a \"no-ego\" Doer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You don't attach your personal self to ideas</li>
            <li>You let others have your best ideas</li>
            <li>You approach new ideas thinking \"what can we do right now?\"</li>
            <li>You are humble</li>
            <li>You always ship code the moment it is better than what is live on our site - no matter what</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>5. Listen First, Then Listen More</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You seek first to understand, then to be understood</li>
            <li>You focus on listening rather than responding</li>
            <li>You take the approach that everything is a hypothesis and you could be wrong</li>
            <li>You are suggestive rather than instructive, replacing phrases such as 'certainly','undoubtedly',
            etc with 'perhaps', 'I think', 'my intuition right now'</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>6. Have a Bias Towards Clarity</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You talk, code, design and write in a clear way instead of being clever</li>
            <li>You over-communicate, repeating things more times than you would intuitively</li>
            <li>You use more words to explain, even if it feels obvious already</li>
            <li>You don't make assumptions, you instead ask that extra question to have the full picture</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>7. Make Time to Reflect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You deliberately find time for reflection, because that's where your life-changing adjustments come from</li>
            <li>You have a calm approach to discussions and ponder points in your own time</li>
            <li>You find time to jump out of the trenches into the higher level thinking that will move the needle</li>
            <li>You understand the value of patience and treat it as a muscle which needs practice to grow</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>8. Live Smarter, Not Harder</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You value waking up fresh over working that extra hour</li>
            <li>You always aim to be fully engaged in an activity, or resting</li>
            <li>You single task your way through the day</li>
            <li>You are at the top of your game, as you focus on expanding capacity of your mental, physical, emotional and spiritual energy</li>
            <li>You choose to be at the single place on Earth where you are the happiest, and most productive, and you are not afraid to find out where that is</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>9. Show Gratitude</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You regularly stop and are grateful for your circumstances</li>
            <li>You are grateful for the work co-workers do to push the company forward and help you move faster</li>
            <li>You approach customer conversations with humility and the knowledge that it's a privilege to
            serve these people</li>
            <li>You have gratitude for platforms, tools and open source that laid the foundation for the possibility
            of the company: \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants\" - Isaac Newton</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>10. Do the Right Thing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You choose what's best for customers and the company in the long-term</li>
            <li>You correct the mistake even when no one would notice</li>
            <li>You strive to provide the best solution, even if that means foregoing profit</li>
            <li>You get excited about opportunities to help others</li>
          </ul>"

        :body "
        <p>Building on our self-management learnings, we have started to make some key changes to how we view
        self-management and work together.</p>
        <p>We're moving away from self-management being synonymous with 'no structure'. We've realized that hierarchy
        and structure are very different things, and structure is key to working efficiently. Some of the changes
        that have resulted include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A bias towards small teams with clear roles. Small teams can feel more ownership and move fast.</li>
          <li>Embracing the idea of higher level work as a separate task carried out by people, rather than spread
          across everyone.</li>
          <li>Starting up mentorship again, through regular 1:1s. 1:1s are a great way to maintain help and
          guidance, without managers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To tie all this together, we have started to develop our own internal tool to help us organize ourselves
        and create visibility to the roles people have. Here are a few screenshots (still very much a work
        in progress):<p>

        These seem like overlapping areas, and could easily be 3 people, or could be one person who has ability
        in all areas. With 1 person rather than 3, it feels possible to move much faster.</p>

          <h3>Retreat</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Our biggest retreat yet, with 31 team members present</li>
            <li>We all flew in from various corners of the world to meet in Iceland</li>
            <li>We also invited <a href=\"https://open.bufferapp.com/family-at-buffer/\">significant others</a> for the first time ever</li>
            <li>It was a fantastic week with a balance of working within our teams, having higher level discussions and activities to bond</li>
            <li><a href=\"https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-retreats/\">Read an article about the evolution of the Buffer retreat and our learnings along the way</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Company Structure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Last month we mentioned a shift towards adding more structure and making roles and commitments explicit</li>
            <li>We have now made the transition to working in small teams of 4-5 people</li>
            <li>We are working based on areas of the product, customer segments, and other logical separations</li>
            <li>We have fully reintroduced mentorship as well as higher level strategy roles. We've re-established everyone in the team having a weekly 1:1 with someone who has significant experience both in their role and within Buffer and with our culture. Several of us in the team have shifted our focus to solving higher level challenges such as company structure, culture of different areas such as product, happiness and engineering, as well as other strategic tasks.</li>
            <li><a href=\"https://open.bufferapp.com/self-management-hierarchy/\">Read an article from Leo where he shares all of our mistakes, learnings and new adjustments for self-management at Buffer</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Happiness, Community and Marketing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>We started to stream some talks from myself and Leo via Periscope and have had a great reception!</li>
            <li>We paused the blog and worked on many other initiatives, with some <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/blog-strategies\">great results and learnings</a></li>
            <li>The Happiness team has also transitioned to working in separate areas, giving more ownership and freedom
            to innovate and progress in individual areas (e.g. Awesome Plan customers, Mobile support, Buffer for Business support)</li>

        to set us up to move much faster. We've successfully split this large team into smaller,
        4-6 person teams that are able to work autonomously and move fast.</p>
        <p>We still have some roles where a single person needs to be working across several teams, and
        a key hiring goal is for us to reach a point where everyone working on products at Buffer is
        focused on a single area. This will help us to move much faster in the future. All of these
        changes and our increased pace are starting to be noticed. Here's a great note we received
        from a customer recently:</p>
        <p><em>\"I'm very surprised! In the last 5 days you add two great features to Buffer. First the
        ability to post videos simultaneously to various accounts and second we now can upload
        thumbnail images to the links we share thru Buffer in Facebook and LinkedIn. I just want to
        say thanks cause I feel heard. And I hope you keep hearing us.\"</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>We launched <a href=\"https://buffer.com/video\">Buffer for Video</a> and it got a
          <a href=\"http://www.producthunt.com/tech/buffer-for-video\">great reception from the community</a>.</li>
          <li>We've validated product/market fit for our <a href=\"https://buffer.com/optimal-scheduling?utm_campaign=schedule_tab\">optimal scheduling tool</a>.</li>

          <p>The reason this has stalled our revenue growth is that it created a 30-day gap with no expiring trials

          <p>This is an expected outcome that we decided was the right move for us to grow Buffer for Business.</p>

          <p>In October, we <a href=\"https://open.buffer.com/no-office/\">closed Buffer's physical office</a>
          to go entirely remote and distributed.</p>
          <p>As we grow, we started experimenting with

          to get the :heartbeat: of Buffer regularly.</p>
          <p>We also evolved some of our team tools: we left HipChat & Sqwiggle for Slack & Zoom and joined Okta as a
          security solution. On the transparency front, Leo shared more details on
          <a href=\"https://open.buffer.com/explaining-equity/\">How We Explain Stock Options to Team Members</a>.</p>

            <li>56 team members across the world in 40 cities (full time + bootcampers)</li>
            <li>In October, 9 teammates completed their bootcamp and 6 of them will be joining us full time. We're
            so excited to welcome:

        <p>In October, the Happiness teams continued to focus on speed for customers who reach out. With response time
        as our primary success metric, we're prioritizing hiring in November. We also added more specialized roles in
        the team, for example, having one liaison between each of the Product and Happiness teams in order to
        streamline some meetings (and cancel others!), as well as one team member focusing on self-help resources.
        We're now hiring to form a Twitter-specific team, too.</p>
        <p>We also separated out business support last month. The new business support and customer success teams
        will focus on the specific needs of customers using Buffer as part of their business strategy. Key metrics
        for this area will include increased customer engagement, reduced churn, NPS score and customer satisfaction
        score to mention a few. We're excited to incorporate new tools and continue to hire in this area as well!</p>
