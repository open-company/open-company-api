;; ----- Test Cases -----

;; Creating stakeholder updates with the REST API

;; The system should store newly created, valid stakeholder updates and handle the following scenarios:

;; OPTIONS

;; POST (stakeholder-update)
;; bad, no JWToken - 401 Unauthorized
;; bad, invalid JWToken - 401 Unauthorized
;; bad, no matching company
;; bad, no sections

;; PATCH (company)
;; bad, invalid sections

;; POST (URL Link, Email, Slack)
;; all good, 1 section - 201 Created
;; all good, many sections - 201 Created
;; all good, custom sections - 201 Created
;; all good, mixed sections - 201 Created

;; no accept
;; no content type
;; no charset
;; wrong accept
;; wrong content type
;; no body
;; wrong charset
;; body not valid JSON
;; no sections in body

;; ----- Data -----

(def link nil)
(def slack {:slack true :note "Slack"})
(def email {:email true :note "Email" :to ["foo@bar.com", "bar@foo.com"]})
