;; ----- Test Cases -----

;; PATCHing company's :sections properties with the REST API.

;; The system should support PATCHing the company's :sections property, and handle the following scenarios:

;; fail - invalid JWToken - 401 Unauthorized
;; fail - no JWToken - 401 Unauthorized
;; fail - organization doesn't match companies - 403 Forbidden

;; fail - no matching company slug - 404 Not Found

;; success - reorder sections
;; success - remove sections
;; success - add sections (blank)
;; success - add sections (with content)

;; TODO
;; no accept
;; no content type
;; no charset
;; wrong accept
;; wrong content type
;; wrong charset

;; ----- Tests -----
