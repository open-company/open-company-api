;; ----- Test Cases -----

;; GETing a company with the REST API

;; The system should return a representation of the company and handle the following scenarios:

;; OPTIONS

;; fail - invalid JWToken - 401 Unauthorized
;; fail - no matching company slug - 404 Not Found

;; success - matching JWToken - 204 No Content
;; success - no JWToken - 204 No Content
;; success - not matching JWToken - 204 No Content

;; GET

;; fail - invalid JWToken - 401 Unauthorized
;; fail - no matching company slug - 404 Not Found

;; success - matching JWToken - 200 OK
;; success - no JWToken - 200 OK
;; success - not matching JWToken - 200 OK

;; TODO
;; no accept
;; no content type
;; no charset
;; wrong accept
;; wrong content type
;; wrong charset
