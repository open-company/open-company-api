;; ----- Test Cases -----

;; Creating companies with the REST API

;; The system should store newly created valid companies and handle the following scenarios:

;; OPTIONS

;; PUT / POST
;; all good - 201 Created
;; all good, no ticker symbol in body - 201 Created
;; all good, unicode in the body - 201 Created

;; bad, no JWToken - 401 Unauthorized
;; bad, invalid JWToken - 401 Unauthorized

;; bad, company slug has invalid characters
;; bad, company slug is too long
;; bad, company slug in body is different than the provided URL

;; no accept
;; no content type
;; no charset
;; conflicting reserved properties
;; wrong accept
;; wrong content type
;; no body
;; wrong charset
;; body not valid JSON
;; no name in body
