;; ----- Test Cases -----

;; GETing a company list with the REST API

;; The system should return a collection of companies and handle the following scenarios:

;; OPTIONS

;; fail - invalid JWToken - 401 Unauthorized

;; success - no JWToken - 204 No Content
;; success - valid JWToken - 204 No Content

;; GET

;; fail - invalid JWToken - 401 Unauthorized

;; success - no JWToken - 200 OK
;; success - valid JWToken - 200 OK

;; TODO
;; no accept
;; no content type
;; no charset
;; wrong accept
;; wrong content type
;; wrong charset

;; ----- Tests -----
