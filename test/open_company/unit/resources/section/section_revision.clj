;; ----- Test Cases -----

;; Updating a section with the Clojure API.

;; The system should support updating the company sections, and handle the following scenarios:

;; success - new section, author is member of the company

;; fail - new section, author is not a member of the company
;; fail - update the section, auther is not a member of the company

;; Section has NO prior note cases:

;; new revision - going from no note to having a note
;; new revision - different author than prior revision
;; new revision - prior update was too long ago

;; same revision - same author and not too long ago


;; Section HAS a prior note cases:

;; new revision - no longer has a note
;; new revision - different author than prior revision
;; new revision - prior update was too long ago

;; new revision - note is by a new author - TODO
;; new revision - note update was too long ago - TODO

;; same revision - same author and not too long ago
