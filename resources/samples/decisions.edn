Anyone that wants a deep dive on the results should check with Danielle.</p><p>It was a <i>great</i> idea from the engineering team, and I really appreciate the enthusiasm for it and the hard work it took to make it happen so quickly. This shows our team at its best.  We know going into it that most of these growth experiment ideas won’t pan out,  but we just have to embrace that and fail fast when we fail.</p>"
