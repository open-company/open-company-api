      <p>Finally, a better way to know what's happening without constant back-and-forth interruptions. Carrot gives each of you a personalized news feed to focus on what matters to you.</p>

      <p>Here are some common ways we'll use Carrot:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Team updates</li>
        <li>CEO updates</li>
        <li>Announcements</li>
        <li>Weekly reviews</li>
        <li>HR and new hires</li>
        <li>Decisions</li>
        <li>Product releases</li>
        <li>Key metrics and results</li>
        <li>Events</li>
        <li>News</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Carrot is ideal for asynchronous updates that don't require immediate attention from your teammates.</p>

      <p>Plus, you can set up a digest to receive a batch of team updates on your preferred schedule. 😍</p>

      <p>It's easy to get started! Give it a try by adding an update or some news to share with everyone. And be sure to <a href=\"javascript:oc.web.actions.nav_sidebar.open_invite_picker()\">invite your teammates to join you.</p>

       :body "True, it’s nice that every update is it’s own thread so it’s less noisy. I also love the digest. I set it up to get updates twice a day, but you can choose your own schedule. It’s much easier to stay focused now."
