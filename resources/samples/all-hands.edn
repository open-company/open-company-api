Cash on hand is <b>$3.1M</b> and the exec. team started weekly meetings to put together the strategy for next years financing. 💰 More to come soon.</p><p>We saw very positive results in one of our growth experiments, “Reward the user”, and no effect in our other experiment, “Email to Get Started”. The growth team is brainstorming how to double down on the positive results, and is discontinuing the “Email to get started” experiment.</p><p>On the product side, we’re moving towards a limited release of the admin dashboard to select customers next week. Let me know if you know of a customer that should be added to the list.</p><p><img src='https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/VTOajSpIRbCDiuIErSks' class='carrot-no-preview' data-media-type='image' data-thumbnail='https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/ZxEKWp3SHKB1c60RnCby' width='494' height='567'></p><p>Major support wins at Bradley Squared and CCNYC!</p><p>In Sales we received word that we are no longer being considered for the Florida deal, but we made the final cut for HIDTA and State Credit.
