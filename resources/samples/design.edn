    :body "<p>Now that our designers are working in pairs, it’s more important than ever to be using a consistent set of elements as we scale our design system out to iOS 🍎 and Android 🤖. <br></p><p>With <a href='https://www.goabstract.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Abstract</a>, now we can work collectively on a single file without worrying about which version is correct. We’re going to get some training setup next week but I assure you it’s incredibly straightforward. If you’re interested in signing up for training, let me know.</p>"
